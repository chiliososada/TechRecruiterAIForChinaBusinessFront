# Debug Steps for Nearest Station Issue

## 🔍 Steps to Debug the Issue

Follow these steps to identify where the problem is occurring:

### Step 1: Open Browser Dev Tools
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the Console tab

### Step 2: Edit an Engineer
1. Navigate to the Engineer List (技術者一覧)
2. Click the edit icon for any engineer
3. In the edit form, modify the "最寄駅" (Nearest Station) field
4. Click Save

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
Look for these specific console messages in order:

```
=== handleChange ===
Updating field nearestStation with value: [your input]

=== Saving engineer ===
Saving engineer with nearestStation: [your input]
Full engineer data: [object with nearestStation field]

=== handleEngineerChange ===
engineer.nearestStation: [your input]

=== handleSaveEdit - selectedEngineer ===
nearestStation: [your input]

=== transformUIToDatabaseEngineer Input ===
[object with nearestStation field]

=== transformUIToDatabaseEngineer Output ===
[object with nearest_station field]

=== useEngineers.updateEngineer START ===
engineerData.nearest_station: [your input]

=== Final data being sent to database ===
updatedEngineer.nearest_station: [your input]

=== About to execute database update ===
Updating engineer ID: [engineer_id]
Tenant ID: [tenant_id]

=== Database update result ===
Updated data: [array with updated engineer data]
Error: null
```

### Step 4: Check Database Directly
After saving, you can verify in the database:
- Check the `engineers` table
- Look for the engineer record with the ID you updated
- Check if the `nearest_station` column has the value you entered

### Step 5: Check List Refresh
After saving:
1. Close the edit dialog
2. Check if the engineer list shows the updated nearest station
3. Look for any error messages

## 🚨 What to Look For

### If logs stop at a certain point:
- **Stops at handleChange**: Input field not working
- **Stops at handleSave**: Save button not working
- **Stops at transform**: Data transformation issue
- **Stops at database update**: API/permission issue

### If logs complete but no database update:
- Check if the `Updated data` in console shows the nearest_station field
- Check if there are any database constraint errors

### If database updates but list doesn't refresh:
- Check if fetchEngineers is called successfully
- Check if the list component is re-rendering with new data

## 🔧 Common Issues to Check

1. **Field Name Mismatch**: UI uses `nearestStation`, DB uses `nearest_station`
2. **Empty String vs Null**: Check if empty strings are being converted to null properly
3. **Database Permissions**: Check if the user has update permissions on the engineers table
4. **Tenant ID Mismatch**: Check if the tenant_id is correct in the update query

Please run through these steps and let me know which console log is the last one you see, or if you see any errors.
